<h4>International Mobile Station Equipment Identity</h4><br>
The IMEI number is used by a GSM network to identify valid devices and therefore can be used for stopping a stolen phone from accessing that network.
For example, if a mobile phone is stolen, the owner can call his or her network provider and instruct them to "blacklist" the phone using its IMEI number. This renders the phone useless on that
network and sometimes other networks too, whether or not the phone's SIM is changed.

<h4>What is Xposed Framework ?</h4><br>
Xposed is a framework for modules that can change the behavior of the system and apps without touching any APKs.
That's great because it means that modules can work for different versions and even ROMs without any changes
(as long as the original code was not changed too much). It's also easy to undo. As all changes are done in the memory,
you just need to deactivate the module and reboot to get your original system back.
There are many other advantages, but here is just one more: Multiple modules can do changes to the
same part of the system or app. With modified APKs, you to decide for one. No way to combine them, unless
the author builds multiple APKs with different combinations.
